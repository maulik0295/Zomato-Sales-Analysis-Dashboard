# Zomato-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard
Zomato is a leading online food delivery platform that connects 
customers with a wide range of restaurants. With a vast network of 
partner restaurants, Zomato aims to offer diverse culinary options to 
its users. 
The dataset provided includes two tables: "Location" and 
"Rating." 
This dataset will serve as a valuable 
resource for Zomato to analyze restaurant data and gain insights into 
customer preferences, allowing for better decision-making and 
strategy formulation. 
Table – Location: The "Location" table contains information about 
various restaurants, including their names, locations, localities, cities, 
and cuisines. The table has the following columns: 
ID: A unique identifier for each restaurant. 
Name: The name of the restaurant. 
Location: The specific address or area where the restaurant is situated. 
Locality: The locality or district where the restaurant is located. 
City: The city in which the restaurant operates. 
Cuisine: The type of cuisine served by the restaurant. It may include 
multiple cuisines separated by commas. 
Table – Rating: The "Rating" table provides details about the ratings, 
votes, and cost of various restaurants. The table includes the following 
columns: 
r_id: A unique identifier for each restaurant. 
Rating: The average rating of the restaurant, indicating customer 
satisfaction. 
Votes: The total number of votes received by the restaurant. 
Cost: The average cost of dining at the restaurant, providing an 
indication of price range.
1. Import the file in Tableau and use the concept of Data Joining to 
join both the tables using an appropriate join. 
2. Create a table showing number of restaurants in each city in 
descending order. 
3. Create a heat map showing average rating of all the cities. 
4. Create a chart to showcase average cost for each city. 
5. Create a chart to visualize the number of branches (franchise) 
each restaurant has. 
6. Create a packed bubble chart to give insights about the Top 10 
restaurants which are available in various cities. 
7. Create a bar chart to showcase best 5 restaurants by their 
average rating and location. The selection should be on the basis 
of a condition that the shortlisted restaurants have received at 
least 10 ratings. 
8. Create four different sheets for KPIs corresponding to: Total 
Restaurants, Average Cost, Average Rating, and Total Votes. 
9. Showcase any insight apart from the above asked questions. 
10. Format all the sheets as per the Zomato theme. 
11. Create a dashboard to use all the created insights. Create a 
dashboard action to select and filter things as per the selection 
made on Question Number (3) sheet in the dashboard. Use a 
filter of city in your dashboard as well. 
12. Create a story to showcase all the sheets and dashboard.
